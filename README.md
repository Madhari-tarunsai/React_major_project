# Shaadi.com Clone Website | Firebase | Project
Project Title: Shaadi.com

ðŸ“ŒProject Overview :

I developed a Shaadi.com clone using React, focusing on building a responsive and user-friendly matrimonial web application. The project utilizes React Router DOM for smooth page navigation, React Icons for visual enhancements, and Axios for API communication. Styling is done entirely with CSS, ensuring a clean and responsive design across devices. I integrated a feature that generates random phone numbers for user profiles to simulate real user data. A unique Astrology Match feature calculates compatibility between the girl and boy based on selected details, adding a personalized touch to the platform. All user data is securely stored in Firebase Firestore, and an Admin Dashboard tracks how many users have logged in to the website, providing basic analytics to monitor user engagement.

Axios â€“ To handle API requests and data fetching

React Icons â€“ For adding lightweight, scalable vector icons

CSS â€“ For responsive and custom styling of all components

Random Data Logic â€“ To generate random phone numbers for profiles

ðŸŒŸ Unique Feature: Instant Astrology Match System


I integrated an Instant Astrology Match System that analyzes key astrological parameters (like name, birth month, or zodiac sign) of both users and provides a real-time compatibility score. This personalized matchmaking experience goes beyond basic profile matching, adding a traditional touch that aligns with cultural expectations while using modern tech.
